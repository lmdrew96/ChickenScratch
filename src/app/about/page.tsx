          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            We began this zine as a way to collect student creative works and share them with our community. 
            Our goal is to inspire not only our readers, but each other. Being college students, we all spend 
            a lot of time reading and writing because we have to, not necessarily because we want to. 
            Unfortunately, this can take all of the enjoyment out of some pretty important forms of self-expression. 
            The Hen & Ink Society and Chicken Scratch are our way of taking back our creativity and using it to 
            uplift and support our community.

            students can explore their creativity, share their work, and connect with fellow writers

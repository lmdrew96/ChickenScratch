## Views Updated

### 1. My Submissions Page (`src/app/mine/page.tsx`)

**Empty State**: When user has no submissions

**Implementation**:
```typescript
<EmptyState
  variant="submissions"
  title="No submissions yet"
  description="You haven't submitted any work yet. Start by creating your first submission to share your writing or visual art with the Chicken Scratch community."
  action={{
    label: "Create your first submission",
    href: "/submit"
  }}
  secondaryAction={{
    label: "View published works",
    href: "/published"
  }}
/>
```

**User Benefits**:
- Clear explanation of why the page is empty
- Direct link to submit new work
- Alternative action to explore published works

### 2. Published Gallery (`src/app/published/page.tsx` & `src/components/gallery/published-gallery-client.tsx`)

**Empty States**:

#### A. No Published Works Exist
```typescript
<EmptyState
  variant="published"
  title="No published works yet"
  description="The Chicken Scratch community hasn't published any works yet. Check back soon to discover amazing stories and artwork, or be the first to submit your own work!"
  action={{
    label: "Submit your work",
    href: "/submit"
  }}
  secondaryAction={{
    label: "Learn more about us",
    href: "/"
  }}
/>
```

#### B. No Search Results
```typescript
<EmptyState
  variant="search"
  title="No published works found"
  description="No published work matches your current filters. Try adjusting your search criteria or clearing all filters to see more results."
  action={{
    label: "Clear all filters",
    onClick: () => {
      setSearchQuery('');
      setTypeFilter('all');
      setIssueFilter('all');
      setCurrentPage(1);
    }
  }}
  secondaryAction={{
    label: "Submit your work",
    href: "/submit"
  }}
/>
```

#### C. Loading Error
```typescript
<EmptyState
  variant="error"
  title="Unable to load gallery"
  description="We couldn't reach the published gallery right now. This might be a temporary issue. Please try refreshing the page or check back in a few moments."
  action={{
    label: "Refresh page",
    onClick: () => window.location.reload()
  }}
  secondaryAction={{
    label: "Go to home",
    href: "/"
  }}
/>
```

**User Benefits**:
- Different messages for different scenarios
- Clear recovery actions
- Encouragement to participate

### 3. Editor Dashboard (`src/components/editor/editor-dashboard.tsx`)

**Empty States**:

#### A. No Submissions to Review
```typescript
<EmptyState
  variant="editor"
  title="No submissions to review"
  description="There are no submissions available for review at this time. Once students begin submitting their work, items will appear here for you to review and manage."
  secondaryAction={{
    label: "View published works",
    href: "/published"
  }}
/>
```

#### B. Loading Error
```typescript
<EmptyState
  variant="error"
  title="Unable to load submissions"
  description="We couldn't load the submission list. This might be a temporary issue. Please try refreshing the page or check back later for updates."
  action={{
    label: "Refresh page",
    onClick: () => window.location.reload()
  }}
/>
```

**User Benefits**:
- Editors understand why dashboard is empty
- Clear distinction between empty state and error state
- Quick recovery action for errors

### 4. Committee Kanban Board (`src/components/committee/kanban-board.tsx`)

**Empty State**: Empty columns in workflow

**Implementation**:
```typescript
<div className="rounded-lg border border-dashed border-white/10 bg-white/5 p-6 text-center">
  <svg className="mx-auto mb-2 h-8 w-8 text-white/30" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={1.5} d="M9 5H7a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2h10a2 2 0 002-2V7a2 2 0 00-2-2h-2M9 5a2 2 0 002 2h2a2 2 0 002-2M9 5a2 2 0 012-2h2a2 2 0 012 2" />
  </svg>
  <p className="text-xs text-white/50">No submissions in this column</p>
</div>
```

**User Benefits**:
- Visual indication that column is intentionally empty
- Consistent with overall design
- Doesn't distract from workflow

## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity
- Clear, concise titles that explain the situation
- Descriptive text that provides context
- No jargon or technical terms

### 2. Helpfulness
- Always provide at least one action the user can take
- Suggest relevant next steps
- Link to related features

### 3. Visual Appeal
- Illustrated icons make empty states more engaging
- Color-coded variants help users understand context
- Consistent styling across all empty states

### 4. Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Clear button labels
- Sufficient color contrast

### 5. Responsiveness
- Works on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Readable text on mobile

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Variant

- **submissions**: User-specific content lists (my submissions, my drafts)
- **published**: Public content galleries
- **search**: Filtered or searched results
- **editor**: Administrative/editorial views
- **committee**: Workflow and process views
- **error**: Error states and loading failures

### Action Button Guidelines

1. **Primary Action**: The most helpful next step
   - Should be directly related to filling the empty state
   - Example: "Create your first submission" on empty submissions page

2. **Secondary Action**: Alternative helpful action
   - Provides context or exploration
   - Example: "View published works" as alternative to creating

3. **Error Recovery**: For error states
   - Should attempt to resolve the issue
   - Example: "Refresh page" for loading errors

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Title**: 3-6 words, action-oriented
   - ✅ "No submissions yet"
   - ❌ "Empty"

2. **Description**: 1-2 sentences, helpful and encouraging
   - Explain why the state is empty
   - Suggest what the user can do
   - Keep tone friendly and supportive

3. **Action Labels**: 2-5 words, verb-first
   - ✅ "Create your first submission"
   - ❌ "Click here"

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Animations**: Add subtle entrance animations
2. **Illustrations**: Replace SVG icons with custom illustrations

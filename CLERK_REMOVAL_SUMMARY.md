# Clerk Authentication Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed Clerk authentication from the project, keeping only Supabase authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Components
- **src/components/layout/site-header.tsx**
  - Removed `@clerk/nextjs` imports (`SignInButton`, `UserButton`)
  - Removed Clerk UI components
  - Kept Supabase login/logout buttons

- **src/app/layout.tsx**
  - Removed `ClerkProvider` import
  - Removed `<ClerkProvider>` wrapper from the component tree

- **src/app/page.tsx**
  - Removed `useUser` hook from `@clerk/nextjs`
  - Removed debug code displaying Clerk authentication status
  - Converted from client component to server component

### 2. Deleted Files and Directories
- **src/app/admin/page.jsx** - Admin page that used Clerk for user management
- **src/app/lib/roles.js** - Role checking utilities that referenced a non-existent `user_roles` table
- **src/app/api/check-role/** - API route for checking user roles via Clerk
- **src/app/api/get-users/** - API route that fetched users from Clerk
- **src/app/api/update-role/** - API route for updating user roles

### 3. Package Management
- Confirmed `@clerk/nextjs` was already not installed in package.json

### 4. Environment Variables
- **your-repo/.env.local**
  - Commented out `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - Commented out `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
  - Kept Supabase environment variables active

## Database Schema Notes
The project uses a `profiles` table (not `user_roles`) that stores user information including roles. This table:
- Uses UUID as the primary key (matching Supabase auth.users)
- Stores role directly in the profile (no separate user_roles table needed)
- Already properly integrated with Supabase authentication

## Current Authentication System
The application now uses **only Supabase** for:
- User authentication (sign up, login, logout)
- Session management
- User profiles and roles
- Authorization checks

## Next Steps (Optional)
If you need admin functionality to manage user roles, you could:
1. Create a new admin page using Supabase queries
2. Add API routes that work with the `profiles` table directly
3. Implement role-based access control using Supabase RLS policies

## Verification
- ✅ No Clerk imports remain in the codebase
- ✅ Build completes successfully (only pre-existing linting warnings)
- ✅ All Clerk-related files removed
- ✅ Environment variables commented out

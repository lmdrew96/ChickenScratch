# Officer Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

The Officers Dashboard has been completely redesigned with working features for officer team management. This implementation provides a comprehensive suite of tools for coordinating team activities, managing tasks, scheduling meetings, and overseeing operations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Team Meeting Scheduler

**Location:** `/components/officers/meeting-scheduler.tsx`

A collaborative availability widget that allows officers to:
- Create meeting proposals with multiple date/time options
- Mark their availability for proposed meeting times
- View who's available for each time slot
- Automatically highlight the most popular time slot
- Finalize meetings when consensus is reached

**Database Tables:**
- `meeting_proposals` - Stores meeting proposals with proposed dates
- `officer_availability` - Tracks which officers are available for which time slots

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/officer/meetings` - Fetch all meeting proposals
- `POST /api/officer/meetings` - Create new meeting proposal
- `PATCH /api/officer/meetings/[id]` - Update availability or finalize meeting

### 2. Officer Tasks

**Location:** `/components/officers/task-manager.tsx`

A full-featured task management system with:
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign tasks to specific officers
- Set priority levels (low, medium, high)
- Set due dates with overdue warnings
- Track task status (To Do, In Progress, Completed)
- Filter tasks by status, priority, and assignee
- Kanban-style board view with three columns

**Database Table:**
- `officer_tasks` - Stores all officer tasks with assignments and metadata

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/officer/tasks` - Fetch all tasks
- `POST /api/officer/tasks` - Create new task
- `PATCH /api/officer/tasks/[id]` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/officer/tasks/[id]` - Delete task

### 3. Officer Announcements

**Location:** `/components/officers/announcements.tsx`

Simple announcement system for team communication:
- Post announcements visible to all officers
- View last 10 announcements with timestamps
- Shows who posted each announcement

**Database Table:**
- `officer_announcements` - Stores announcements with creator info

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/officer/announcements` - Fetch recent announcements
- `POST /api/officer/announcements` - Create new announcement

### 4. Admin Tools

**Location:** `/components/officers/admin-tools.tsx`

Quick access section for admin officers (BBEG, Dictator-in-Chief):
- Links to admin dashboard
- Links to user management
- Quick stats display (total users, committee members, pending submissions)
- Only visible to officers with admin positions

### 5. Stats Dashboard

**Location:** `/components/officers/stats-dashboard.tsx`

Real-time statistics display showing:
- Submissions this month
- Pending reviews
- Published pieces
- Active committee members

## Database Schema

### meeting_proposals
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- title (text, required)
- description (text)
- proposed_dates (jsonb array)
- finalized_date (timestamp, nullable)
- created_by (uuid, references auth.users)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)
```

### officer_availability
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- meeting_proposal_id (uuid, references meeting_proposals)
- available_slots (jsonb array of slot indexes)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)
- UNIQUE constraint on (user_id, meeting_proposal_id)
```

### officer_tasks
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- title (text, required)
- description (text)
- assigned_to (uuid, nullable, references auth.users)
- created_by (uuid, references auth.users)
- status (enum: 'todo', 'in_progress', 'completed')
- priority (enum: 'low', 'medium', 'high')
- due_date (date, nullable)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)
```

### officer_announcements
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- message (text, required)
- created_by (uuid, references auth.users)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## Access Control

All features are protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies that check:
- User has 'officer' role in user_roles.roles, OR
- User has an officer position (BBEG, Dictator-in-Chief, Scroll Gremlin, Chief Hoarder, PR Nightmare)

Admin-specific features additionally check for BBEG or Dictator-in-Chief positions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# The migration file is located at:
# supabase/migrations/create_officer_tables.sql

# Apply it to your Supabase database through the Supabase dashboard
# or using the Supabase CLI
```

### 2. Verify RLS Policies

All tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies. Verify in Supabase dashboard:
- meeting_proposals: Officers can view, create, and update
- officer_availability: Officers can view all, manage their own
- officer_tasks: Officers can view, create, update, and delete
- officer_announcements: Officers can view and create

### 3. Test Access

1. Log in as a user with officer role/position
2. Navigate to `/officers`
3. Verify all sections are visible and functional

## UI/UX Features

- **Dark Theme:** Consistent with Chicken Scratch design system
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Loading States:** All components show loading indicators
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error messages for failed operations
- **Empty States:** Helpful messages when no data exists
- **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects, transitions, and visual feedback
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, proper labels, keyboard navigation

## Component Architecture

```
/app/officers/page.tsx (Server Component)
├── Fetches data (officers list, stats, user permissions)
├── Passes data to client components
└── Renders layout with all sections

/components/officers/
├── meeting-scheduler.tsx (Client Component)
│   ├── Manages meeting proposals
│   ├── Handles availability marking
│   └── Finalizes meetings
├── task-manager.tsx (Client Component)
│   ├── CRUD operations for tasks
│   ├── Filtering and status management
│   └── Kanban board display
├── announcements.tsx (Client Component)
│   ├── Displays recent announcements
│   └── Creates new announcements
├── admin-tools.tsx (Client Component)
│   ├── Admin navigation links
│   └── Quick stats display
└── stats-dashboard.tsx (Client Component)
    └── Real-time statistics cards
```

## API Architecture

All API routes follow RESTful conventions:
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Return appropriate status codes
- Include error handling and logging
- Verify officer access on every request
- Use Supabase RLS as additional security layer

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Email notifications for task assignments and meeting finalizations
2. Calendar integration for finalized meetings
3. Task comments and activity history
4. Meeting notes and action items
5. File attachments for tasks
6. Recurring meeting proposals
7. Task templates for common workflows
8. Analytics and reporting dashboard
9. Export functionality for tasks and meetings
10. Mobile app for on-the-go access

## Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors
The new database tables aren't in the TypeScript types yet. These errors won't affect functionality but can be resolved by regenerating types:
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/types/database.ts
```

### Access Denied
If officers can't access the dashboard:
1. Verify user has 'officer' role or officer position in user_roles table
2. Check RLS policies are enabled and correct
3. Verify migration was applied successfully

### Data Not Loading
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify Supabase connection is working
3. Check that tables exist in database
4. Verify RLS policies allow the operation

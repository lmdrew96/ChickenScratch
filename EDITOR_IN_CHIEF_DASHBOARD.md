# Editor-in-Chief Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Redesigned the `/editor` page as a comprehensive high-level overview dashboard exclusively for users with the "Editor-in-Chief" position.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Access Restriction ✅
- **Authorization**: Changed from requiring 'editor' or 'committee' role to ONLY allowing "Editor-in-Chief" position
- **Check Method**: Validates `user_roles.positions` array for "Editor-in-Chief"
- **Redirect Logic**:
  - Committee members → `/committee`
  - All others → `/mine`

### Phase 2: Dashboard Metrics & Stats ✅

#### 1. Key Metrics Cards (4-column grid)
- **Total Submissions**: All-time submission count
- **Pending Review**: Submissions with null or `pending_coordinator` status
- **In Progress**: Submissions in active workflow (`with_coordinator`, `with_proofreader`, `with_lead_design`)
- **Published**: Submissions with `published` status

#### 2. Workflow Status Breakdown
Visual breakdown showing counts for each committee status:
- New (no status)
- Pending Coordinator
- With Coordinator
- Coordinator Approved
- With Proofreader
- Proofreader Committed
- With Lead Design
- Lead Design Committed
- With Editor-in-Chief
- Published

Each status displays with color-coded badges matching the existing design system.

#### 3. Bottleneck Detection
- **Stuck Submissions**: Identifies submissions in one status for >7 days
- **Highest Backlog Alert**: Highlights which workflow stage has the most submissions
- **Top 5 Display**: Shows the 5 oldest stuck submissions with days count

#### 4. Recent Activity Feed
- Displays last 10 submissions sorted by `updated_at`
- Shows title, current status, and timestamp
- Formatted with readable date/time display

#### 5. Submissions by Type
- **Visual Breakdown**: Writing vs Visual Art with progress bars
- **Percentage Display**: Shows distribution as percentage of total
- **Genre Distribution**: Top 5 genres with submission counts

### Phase 3: Quick Actions ✅
- **View Full Committee Workflow**: Links to `/committee` page
- **Export Report**: Placeholder button (disabled, marked "Coming Soon")

### Phase 4: Design System ✅
All components follow the existing Chicken Scratch design:
- Dark theme with `border-white/10` borders
- `rounded-2xl` cards with `bg-white/5` backgrounds
- Consistent color scheme:
  - Yellow for pending/warnings
  - Blue for in-progress
  - Green for published/success
  - Red for declined
  - Purple, indigo, pink, cyan for various workflow stages
- Responsive grid layouts (sm:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3/4)
- Proper spacing with `space-y-8` and `gap-6`

### Phase 5: Data Fetching ✅
- **Server-Side**: Uses `createSupabaseServerReadOnlyClient`
- **Query**: Fetches all submissions ordered by `created_at DESC`
- **Error Handling**: Proper try-catch with console logging
- **Calculations**: All metrics computed server-side for performance

## Features

### Access Control
```typescript
const isEditorInChief = userRole?.positions?.includes('Editor-in-Chief');
if (!isEditorInChief) {
  redirect(userRole?.roles?.includes('committee') ? '/committee' : '/mine');
}
```

### Bottleneck Detection Algorithm
```typescript
const bottlenecks = submissions
  .filter((s) => getDaysSince(s.updated_at) > 7 && s.status !== 'published')
  .sort((a, b) => getDaysSince(b.updated_at) - getDaysSince(a.updated_at));
```

### Status Color Mapping
Each committee status has a unique color scheme:
- `pending_coordinator`: Yellow
- `with_coordinator`: Blue
- `coordinator_approved`: Emerald
- `coordinator_declined`: Rose
- `with_proofreader`: Purple
- `proofreader_committed`: Indigo
- `with_lead_design`: Pink
- `lead_design_committed`: Cyan
- `with_editor_in_chief`: Amber
- `published`: Green

## Helper Functions

### `formatCommitteeStatus(status)`
Converts snake_case status to Title Case display text.

### `getStatusColor(status)`
Returns Tailwind classes for color-coded status badges.

### `getDaysSince(date)`
Calculates days elapsed since a given date for bottleneck detection.

## User Experience

### Dashboard Sections (Top to Bottom)
1. **Page Header**: "Editor-in-Chief Dashboard"
2. **Key Metrics**: 4 large metric cards
3. **Workflow Breakdown**: Grid of all status counts
4. **Bottleneck Detection**: Warning alerts and stuck submissions
5. **Two-Column Layout**:
   - Left: Recent Activity Feed
   - Right: Submissions by Type & Genre
6. **Quick Actions**: Navigation buttons

### Responsive Design
- Mobile: Single column, stacked sections
- Tablet: 2-column grids where appropriate
- Desktop: Full 4-column metrics, 3-column workflow grid

## Security
- Server-side authorization check before rendering
- Read-only database client for data fetching
- No client-side data mutations
- Proper redirect for unauthorized users

## Future Enhancements
- Export Report functionality (CSV/PDF)
- Committee member activity tracking
- Clickable submission titles linking to details
- Real-time updates with polling or websockets
- Customizable date ranges for metrics
- Trend charts showing submission flow over time

# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the three critical bugs that were fixed in the deployment.

## BUG 1: Toast Context Error ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Error message: "Toast context unavailable. Wrap components with <ToastProvider>"
- Components using `useToast()` hook were throwing errors
- ToastProvider was not wrapping the application

### Solution
Added `ToastProvider` to the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`):
- Imported `ToastProvider` from `@/components/ui/toast`
- Wrapped the application with `<ToastProvider>` inside `<SupabaseProvider>`
- This ensures all components can access toast notifications

### Files Changed
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added ToastProvider wrapper

### Testing
After this fix, toast notifications should work throughout the app, particularly on:
- Submit page (form submission feedback)
- Editor dashboard (status updates)
- Any page using the `useToast()` hook

---

## BUG 2: Published Page 500 Error ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Error: GET /published returns 500 Internal Server Error
- The published page was trying to query `published_url` and `issue` columns
- These columns didn't exist in the database submissions table
- This caused a database query error and server crash

### Root Cause
The TypeScript types defined these columns (`src/types/database.ts`), but no migration had been created to actually add them to the database schema.

### Solution
Created migration `supabase/migrations/add_published_fields.sql`:
- Adds `published_url` column (TEXT) to submissions table
- Adds `issue` column (TEXT) to submissions table
- Uses conditional logic to avoid errors if columns already exist

### Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/add_published_fields.sql` - New migration file

### How to Apply
Run one of these commands to apply the migration:

**Option A: Using Supabase CLI**
```bash
cd your-repo
supabase db push
```

**Option B: Manual SQL Execution**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/add_published_fields.sql`
3. Paste and execute

### Testing
After applying the migration:
1. Visit `/published` - should load without 500 error
2. The page should display published submissions or an empty state
3. Check browser console - no database errors

## BUG 3: User Roles Not Assigned ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The admin user doesn't have the required positions:
- "Dictator-in-Chief" 
- "Editor-in-Chief"

### Root Cause
The `user_roles` table uses arrays for `roles` and `positions` (after migrations), but the admin user either:
- Doesn't have a row in `user_roles` table
- Has empty arrays for positions
- Has the old single-value columns instead of arrays

### Solution
1. **Updated ADMIN_SETUP.md** with correct array syntax
2. **Created migration template** (`supabase/migrations/assign_admin_positions.sql`)

### How to Fix

**Step 1: Find Your User ID**
Visit `/test-role` in your browser while logged in to see your user ID and current role data.

**Step 2: Assign Admin Positions**

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → `user_roles`
2. Find your user row (or create one)
3. Set these values:
   - `is_member`: `true`
   - `roles`: `["officer"]`
   - `positions`: `["Dictator-in-Chief", "Editor-in-Chief"]`

**Option B: Using SQL**
```sql
-- Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID' with your actual UUID from /test-role
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, is_member, roles, positions)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid, 
  true, 
  ARRAY['officer']::TEXT[], 
  ARRAY['Dictator-in-Chief', 'Editor-in-Chief']::TEXT[]
)
ON CONFLICT (user_id) 
DO UPDATE SET 
  is_member = true,
  roles = ARRAY['officer']::TEXT[],
  positions = ARRAY['Dictator-in-Chief', 'Editor-in-Chief']::TEXT[];
```

### Files Changed
- `ADMIN_SETUP.md` - Updated with correct array syntax
- `supabase/migrations/assign_admin_positions.sql` - Template for assigning roles

### Testing
After assigning roles:
1. Visit `/test-role` - should show your positions array with both roles
2. Visit `/admin` - should have access (no redirect)
3. Try editing user roles in admin panel - should work

---

## Summary of All Changes

### Files Modified
1. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added ToastProvider
2. `ADMIN_SETUP.md` - Updated for array-based roles/positions

### Files Created
1. `supabase/migrations/add_published_fields.sql` - Adds missing database columns
2. `supabase/migrations/assign_admin_positions.sql` - Template for admin role assignment
3. `BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Deployment Checklist

- [x] Fix 1: Add ToastProvider to layout
- [x] Fix 2: Create migration for published_url and issue columns
- [x] Fix 3: Update admin setup documentation
- [ ] Apply database migrations (run `supabase db push`)
- [ ] Assign admin positions to your user
- [ ] Test all three fixes
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Verify admin access works

### Next Steps

1. **Apply the database migration** for the published page fix
2. **Assign admin roles** to your user account
3. **Test each page** to verify fixes:
   - Submit page - test form submission with toast notifications
   - Published page - should load without errors
   - Admin page - should have access with proper roles
4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `/test-role` to see your current role data
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Check server logs for database errors
4. Verify all migrations have been applied
5. Ensure `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials
